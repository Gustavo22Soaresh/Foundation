# Atlas Design System

Welcome to the **Atlas Design System** for OpenStreetMap! This project aims to provide a consistent and scalable foundation for creating user interfaces aligned with OpenStreetMap's visual identity and principles. Here, you'll find Design Tokens, Components, Icons, Resources, and guidelines for usage and contributions.

## Design Tokens
Design Tokens are the foundation of our design system. They define colors, typography, spacing, borders, and other visual properties to ensure consistency across all products and platforms.

- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, and neutral color palettes.
- **Typography**: Fonts, sizes, and weights.
- **Spacing**: Margins, paddings, and grids.
- **Borders and Shadows**: Border styles and shadow effects.

## Components and Icons
Our library of components and icons is designed to be modular and reusable, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

- **Components**: Buttons, forms, cards, modals, navigation, and more.
- **Icons**: We currently use [**Material Symbols**](https://fonts.google.com/icons) as our icon library.

## Resources
Here, you'll find additional resources to help with the implementation and understanding of the Design System.

- [**Figma Library**](https://www.figma.com/design/2vheURjyvYg2oyBeuQOxQ1/Atlas---Design-System?node-id=458-2470&t=831K8B3NnQoe1vdt-1): Component and style library in Figma.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides on how to use and customize components.
- **Usage Examples**: Practical implementation examples.
